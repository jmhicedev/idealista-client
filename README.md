# idealista-client
Client for Idealista API. I am trying to communicate with the API of Idealista.

I am starting this project, if you want to colaborate, you only have to do it. Welcome!!

For now, I only have a simple spring boot project which is able to authenticate in Idealista server and make a request of searching. There is so much work left.
